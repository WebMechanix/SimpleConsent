### ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Disclaimer! ‚ö†Ô∏è

**The maintainers of this library are not data-privacy lawyers, and this library's defaults and/or example configurations are not a substitute for proper legal counsel**.

As such, installing this tool on your website does not "magically" make you compliant with regional data collection laws - it must be configured properly with Google Tag Manager to work correctly.

**It cannot be understated to always consult with a data privacy professional to ensure your consent banner configuration is compliant with regional data collection laws.**

---

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è This project is in active development ‚ö†Ô∏è** 
A proper release will be tagged when ready. There are likely bugs and missing features at this point in time.

#### Foreword

This project is/was inspired by [Klaro](https://github.com/klaro-org/klaro-js). Klaro is another great open-source consent project, and does a LOT more than this library - especially around "autoblocking" behavior. However, Klaro takes a "services first" approach to its configuration instead of "consent types". This makes Klaro a bit harder to use with GTM and more specifically its consent signal APIs that are "type/behavior" focused. So TL;DR - if this library doesn't fit your needs, check out Klaro - it very well could.

### Why should I use this?

SimpleConsent is a tool to help technical marketers and/or developers comply with the data-collection laws using a lightweight alternative to expensive 3rd party services like OneTrust or CookieBot. 

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightweight (< 10KB gzipped)
[![JS GZip Size](https://img.badgesize.io/derekcavaliero/simpleconsent/main/dist/SimpleConsent.min.js?compression=gzip&label=JS%20GZip%20size)](https://github.com/derekcavaliero/simpleconsent/blob/main/dist/SimpleConsent.min.js)
[![CSS GZip Size](https://img.badgesize.io/derekcavaliero/simpleconsent/main/dist/SimpleConsent.min.css?compression=gzip&label=CSS%20GZip%20size)](https://github.com/derekcavaliero/simpleconsent/blob/main/dist/SimpleConsent.min.css)

Compare this to bloated CMPs like OneTrust or CookieBot which can be 100KB+ in size AFTER GZip compression.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration First
If you... 
- Can write basic JSON structures, you can configure it 
- Can write some basic CSS, you can style it
- Use a front-end component library (e.g. Bootstrap or similar), you can edit the underlying UI templates
- Have access to Cloudflare Workers, or Server-Side GTM, (or similar tech) you can create geolocation routing

#### üè∑Ô∏è Google Tag Manager (GTM) Focused
Designed to work with GTM's consent signal APIs and provide better ergonomics for GTM users.

### SimpleConsent might be for you if...

1. ‚úÖ You use Google Tag Manager (GTM) as your TMS
2. ‚úÖ You aren't afraid to write some basic JS/JSON and CSS to configure and customize it.
3. ‚úÖ You want a 1st party solution that doesn't rely on 3rd party services. 
4. ‚úÖ You're fed up with bloated CMPs like OneTrust or CookieBot hurting your site's performance.

### SimpleConsent isn't for you if...

1. ‚ùå You don't use Google Tag Manager (GTM) as your TMS
2. ‚ùå You require "autoblocking" behavior
3. ‚ùå You want a "low code" solution.
4. ‚ùå You require IAB TCF v2.X compaitibility (might be added in the future - no promises)
5. ‚ùå You require AMP compatibility (no plans to support this)
6. ‚ùå You require support for dead browsers like Internet Explorer (no plans to support this)
7. ‚ùå You need bundled "baked in" (cookie pun intended) geolocation routing or a built-in cookie scanner.

### Getting Started

#### Installation

In order to use SimpleConsent, 2 things are required. If you have used Klaro before, the process is identical.

1. **Stylesheet** (SimpleConsent.min.css) (if using the default theme)
2. **A configuration file/object** (consentConfig.js) that is loaded by your site. You may also have your configuration bundled into other JS files if you prefer - but for the sake of maintainability, it is recommended to keep it separate.
3. **Main Library** (SimpleConsent.min.js) with a `data-consent-config` attribute that points to the global configuration object that will be loaded. 

You can do this by adding the following code to your website's `<head>`.

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/derekcavaliero/simpleconsent@latest/dist/SimpleConsent.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script defer src="/path/to/consentConfig.js"></script>
<script defer
  data-consent-config="consentConfig"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/derekcavaliero/simpleconsent@latest/dist/SimpleConsent.min.js"></script>
```

#### Configuration

Inside the `consentConfig.js` (or whatever you chose for a filename) file, you will need to define a global object called `consentConfig` (or whatever you chose for global object) that will be used to configure the consent manager behavior. This configuration object is merged with the default configuration object provided by the library allowing you to override any default settings. 

```javascript
/** 
 * ‚ÑπÔ∏è SimpleConsent will clean up the global scope after initialization, 
 * As such, this object will not be available to other scripts on your page.
 */
window.consentConfig = window.consentConfig || {
  consentModel: 'opt-out',
  content: {
    banner: {
      title: 'üç™ Notice',
      description: 'This website uses cookies (or other browser storage) to deliver our services and/or analyze our website usage.',
    }
  }
}
```

The above example will display a banner with the title "üç™ Notice" and use an "opt-out" consent model (meaning the default consent types are all enabled until the user disables them).

You can view the source of the default `#config` object in the SimpleConsent class. Each configration object is annotated with JSDoc comments to help you understand what each property does.

### Defining Consent Types

Consent types are the individual categories of data collection that your website performs. These can be anything from "Analytics" to "Marketing" or "Functional" data collection. Each consent type can have the following properties:

- **`name`** (string) - The title of the consent type (what is show to the end user)
- **`description`** (string) - A description of the consent type usually a brief explanation of what services/storage is used for the consent type.
- **`required`** (boolean) - Whether or not the consent type is required for the website to function properly. Note, the library will automatically add a "necessary" type - you do not need to define one explicitly.
- **`gpc`** (boolean) - If set to `true`, the consent type will be automatically disabled if a `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` is detected. This is useful for respecting the user's browser settings.\
- **`mapTo`** (array) - If you wish to map a particular consent type to other consent types (useful for Google's Consent Mode). This is an array of strings that represent the names of other consent types. (e.g. `ad_user_data`, `ad_storage`, `ad_personalization` etc...).

**Example:**
```json
"types": {
  "analytics_storage": {
    "name": "Analytics & Performance",
    "description": "Enables storage and services that are used to measure visits, sessions, and certain types of on-page activity (such as clicks on buttons).",
    "gpc": true,
  },
  "advertising": {
    "name": "Advertising Targeting & Measurement",
    "description": "Enables services and services for all advertising purposes. This includes, ad personalization, advertising cookies, user data shared with our advertising partners.",
    "mapTo" : ["ad_storage", "ad_personalization", "ad_user_data"],
    "gpc": true,
  },
  "personalization_storage": {
    "name": "Personalization Storage",
    "description": "Enables storage and services related to personalization e.g. video recommendations, and account preferences.",
  },
  "functionality_storage": {
    "name": "Functional Storage",
    "description": "Enables storage and services that supports the functionality of the website or app (e.g. language settings).",
  },
  "security_storage": {
    "name": "Security Storage",
    "description": "Enables storage and services related to security such as authentication functionality, fraud prevention, and other user protection.",
    "required": true,
  }
}
```

Each consent type is defined with its own "key" (e.g. `analytics_storage`, `advertising`, etc...). These keys are used to reference the consent types in the configuration object. These are also the keys that are used when pushing `dataLayer` events to Google Tag Manager, and also the stored consent object in cookies and/or localStorage.

### Defining Services

Services are the individual scripts or tags that are loaded on your website that require consent. A service can belong to one or more consent types. Services are defined using the `services` property in the configuration object. This services object is used to generate a cookie policy, and each service will be listed under its respective consent type inside the consent settings modal.

**Example:**
```json
"services": {
  "cloudflare": {
    "name": "Cloudflare",
    "description": "Provides security and performance optimization for websites, protecting them from malicious traffic while improving load times by caching content and optimizing delivery.",
    "domain": "cloudflare.com",
    "storage": {
      "security": {
        "__cf_bm": {
          "purpose": "Contains information related to the calculation of Cloudflare's proprietary bot score and, when Anomaly Detection is enabled on Bot Management, a session identifier.",
          "expires": "30 minutes"
        }
      }
    },
    "types": ["necessary", "security_storage"]
  },
  "google_analytics": {
    "name": "Google Analytics",
    "description": "Tracks and reports website traffic and user behavior, helping to analyze visitor data for improving site performance and user experience.",

    "storage": {
      "analytics_storage": {
        "_ga": {
          "purpose": "Browser (client) indentifer. Used to distinguish a unique browser (anonymous user).",
          "expires": "2 years"
        },
        "_ga_XXXXXXXXXX": {
          "pattern": "/_ga_[A-Z\\d]{6,}/",
          "purpose": "Session indentifer. Used to distinguish current session, session count, and other related session information.",
          "expires": "2 years"
        }
      }
    },
    "types": ["analytics_storage", "advertising"]
  },
  "google_ads": {
    "name": "Google Ads",

          "purpose": "This cookie keeps track of sessions. This is used to determine if HubSpot should increment the session number and timestamps in the __hstc cookie. It contains the domain, viewCount (increments each pageView in a session), and session start timestamp.",

        "hubspotutk": {

        }
      }
    },
    "types": ["analytics_storage", "personalization_storage"]
  }
}
```

### Google Tag Manager Configuration

#### `simple-consent:load` Event

When the consent banner is loaded, a `dataLayer` event is pushed to Google Tag Manager with the following structure:

```javascript
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'simple-consent:load',
  consent: {
    // key:value pairs for each consent type set to "granted" or "denied".
    // If a type is mapped to another type, the mapped type will be set to the same value as the original type (see "mapTo" in the advertising type definition above)
    analytics_storage: 'denied',
    advertising: 'denied',
    ad_storage: 'denied',
    ad_personalization: 'denied',
    ad_user_data: 'denied',
    personalization_storage: 'denied',
    functionality_storage: 'denied',
    security_storage: 'granted',
  },
  consentMeta: {
    consentModel: 'opt-in', // opt-in or opt-out - pulled from the loaded config.
    geo: null,              // a value from your own geolocation lookup if using a multi-config setup null otherwise
    gpc: false,             // true if the user has Global Privacy Control enabled false otherwise
  }
})
```

Directly before the `simple-consent:load` event payload is pushed, a `gtag('consent', 'default', {})` command is pushed with the same payload (minus the `event`, and `consentMeta` properties). This ensures that the consent signal is properly set in Google Tag Manager before any tags configured to use the consent signal are fired.

#### `simple-consent:update` Event

```javascript
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'simple-consent:update',
  consent: {
    analytics_storage: 'granted',
    advertising: 'granted',
    ad_storage: 'granted',
    ad_personalization: 'granted',
    ad_user_data: 'granted',
    personalization_storage: 'granted',
    functionality_storage: 'granted',
    security_storage: 'granted',
  },
  consentMeta: { 
    //... 
  }
})
```

Similar to `simple-consent:load`, directly before the `simple-consent:update` event payload is pushed, a `gtag('consent', 'update', { ... })` command is pushed with the same payload (minus the `event`, and `consentMeta` properties).

#### Trigger/Variable Setup

The in most cases - you'll likely have a "Consent / grated - [type]" trigger for each consent type that you want to fire tags on. It's suggested to use a custom event trigger that matches both the load and update events via regex `simple-consent:(load|update)` to handle both opt-in and opt-out consent models.

##### IMPORTANT NOTES
- You should not use any "All Pages", "Initialization", or "Consent Initialization" trigger types for any of your tags that require consent. Doing so will result in the tags firing before the consent signals are set. Instead, use the `simple-consent:load` custom event as a trigger for your tags that should fire on page load or related events.
- Be aware that the "Require additional consent for tag to fire" has a known bug with "fire one per page" tags. For this reason, its best to avoid using the additional consent checks feature at this point in time.
